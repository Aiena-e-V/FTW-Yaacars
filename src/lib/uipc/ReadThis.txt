FSUIPC Developer Kit: Library for MSVC/C++ programmers
======================================================

To interface to FSUIPC (versions 1.998e or later) in your MSVC/C++ programs:

* insert the LIB and Header file into your source folder
* include the header in your source module(s) (#include "...")
* add the Lib to the list of Libs in the Link section of the Project Settings
* call the appropriate Library routines in your code.

More on this last part (and please also refer to the UIPCHello example
provided):

Opening the link to FSUIPC
==========================

For this you use the following Library toutine:

	BOOL FSUIPC_Open(DWORD dwFSReq, DWORD *pdwResult);

where
	dwFSReq specified which Flight Simulator you want to connect to:
	
		SIM_ANY	for any supported by FSUIPC or equivalent	
		SIM_FS98	FS98
		SIM_FS2K	FS2000
		SIM_FS2K2	FS2002
		SIM_FS2K4	FS2004
		SIM_FSX	FSX
		SIM_ESP	ESP (first version)
		SIM_CFS2	CFS2
		SIM_CFS1	CFS
and
	pResult is a pointer to a DWORD to receive an error number if the
	operation fails.
	
If FSUIPC_Open returns "FALSE" then the value in the result DWORD will
tell you what went wrong. The errors currently possible are defined in
the Header file (see the list of FSUIPC_ERR_ ... definitions).

If it returns "TRUE" then the link is open and ready for your requests.
Already the Library routine will have obtained some data for you:

	DWORD FSUIPC_Version;	// HIWORD is 1000 x Version Number, minimum 1998
							// LOWORD is build letter, with a = 1 etc.
	DWORD FSUIPC_FS_Version;
							// SIM_FS98, SIM_FS2K etc -- see above


Closing the link
================

Before terminating your program, or trying to re-open (e.g. to re-connect
after a lost connection, possibly due to FS crashing or closing), you must
Close the link to free up the resources it uses:

	void FSUIPC_Close(void);
	
There is no harm done if you Close a link that is already Closed.



Specifying the requests
=======================

The interface to FSUIPC and hence the simulator is simply one of reads and
writes from and to specific "offsets". These "were originally true offsets
into a specific Global data earea within FS, but nowadays, at least in FS2000
and CFS they are more likely to be treated a Identifiers to specific
variables, and are translated within FSUIPC. However, you may still address
data with contiguous offsets in blocks, as FSUIPC breaks these down if it
needs to.

The following Library calls are used to accumulate Read and Write requests:

	BOOL FSUIPC_Read(DWORD dwOffset, DWORD dwSize,
											void *pDest, DWORD *pdwResult);
	BOOL FSUIPC_Write(DWORD dwOffset, DWORD dwSize,
											void *pSrce, DWORD *pdwResult);
											
In both cases you supply an offset, identifying the data required or to be
written, and a size (in bytes). The pointers "pDest" for reads and "pSrce"
for writes naturally must point to the area to receive the result or (for
writes) the area containing the data to be written. These pointers are defined
as "void *" here so that you can use whatever component size or structure you
like, as appropriate for the data in question.

The DWORD for the result is used to identify the reason for error should the
return be FALSE. The only possible errors on these calls are an unopened
link or a full data area. You can only accumulate so much data before you need
to get FSUIPC to "process" it. This is next:


Processing the requests
=======================

	BOOL FSUIPC_Process(DWORD *pdwResult);
	
This routine sends all the requests accumulated using the Read and Write calls
since the last Process call (if any). It is this call which actually operates
the interface.

As usual , the error number in the Result DWORD needs to be checked if this
call returns FALSE, indicating an error.

Note that, if your program is run under WideClient, it is likely that your
first requests for data are met with zeroes for everything. this is because
WideClient sends off the request but meanwhile returns what it already has. If
you depend on seeing correct data from the outset, you will need to wait some
milliseconds (100 or more is good, 500 safer) and read again.

If you are coninually reading the same data over and over in a loop, as when,
for instance, maintaining a moving map position and so on, the initial values
from Wideclient shouldn't be any bother. But remember, in loops, allow some
time for other processes to run, and also process your own Windows messages.
